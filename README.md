# Hangman

  Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people
  played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game
  and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code
  Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited
  number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with
  the guessing!<br/><br/>

# To-Do List

To-Do list can improve your work and personal life. You can use it to reduce the stress in your life and get more done in less time. It also helps you become more reliable for other people and save time for the best things in life. And also you will learn the basics of SQLAlchemy to manage SQLite database on python!
